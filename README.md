# tm_police
Time Machine police scripts help to auto exclude unnecessary files and directories which can be restore without using backup and reduce backup size and backup time

It's simple description of main goal.

Manual control of exclusion from backup is ugly. I want to create console tools for control it.

You can exclude folders in Time Machine preference but it is unusable. In other hand you can use xattr of HFS. I use second way.
